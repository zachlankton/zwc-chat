1. **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** - Community standards and behavior guidelines (skipped for now)

## Recent Work

- Added `messagesRef` with `useRef` to maintain current messages state in the callback

## Notes
- All basic documentation structure is in place, just need to finish the remaining files
- Consider adding:
  - API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
  - Architecture diagrams
  - Deployment guides
  - Testing documentation
